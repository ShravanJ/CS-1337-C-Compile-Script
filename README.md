# CS-1337-CPP-Compile-Script
a simple bash script for compiling c++ source using strict parameters for CS 1337

make sure you make it executable first using chmod +x compile.sh

Sublime Text 2 Support
======================
Added a sublime build file that integrates into the Sublime Text 2 build system, so you will not have to run the script seperately every time you compile.

To use this on Windows, drop the file into C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\C++

To use this on OS X/macOS, drop the file into /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/C++
